# vim-tidal-re #

A Vim plugin for [TidalCycles](http://tidal.lurk.org/), the language for live
coding musical patterns written in Haskell.

This is an alternative to [vim-tidal](https://github.com/munshkr/vim-tidal),
which uses *tmux* to communicate with the Tidal interpreter.  In contrast, this
uses Vim 8 channels for communication.

**Vim 8+ is required. For Vim 7 or older, use
[vim-tidal](https://github.com/munshkr/vim-tidal) instead.**

# vim-tidal-re #

A Vim plugin for [TidalCycles](http://tidal.lurk.org/), the language for live
coding musical patterns written in Haskell.

This plugin uses Vim channels and jobs to communicate with the Tidal
interpreter, so you need either Vim 7.4+ with `+channel` and `+job` or Neovim.
Otherwise, use [vim-tidal](https://github.com/munshkr/vim-tidal) instead.
